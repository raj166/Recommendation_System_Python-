# Recommender Systems with Python

Welcome to the code notebook for Recommender Systems with Python. In this notebook i have  develop basic recommendation systems using Python and pandas.

In this notebook, i  have focused on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item based on the rattings,
in this case, movies. Keep in mind, this is not a true robust recommendation system, to describe it more accurately,it just tells you what movies/items 
are most similar to your movie choice.
